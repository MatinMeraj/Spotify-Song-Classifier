# Concise Project Accomplishments (15-Second Scan)

## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

**Song Mood Classification System** | Python, Machine Learning
• **Developed** ML system **achieving 79% accuracy** in 4-class mood classification using ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning
• **Engineered** 14 multi-modal features from audio signals and lyrics **improving model performance by 22%** over baseline
• **Resolved** Spotify API integration failures **by implementing robust fallback mechanisms** and synthetic data generation
• **Created** automated visualization pipeline **generating 5 comprehensive analytics** for model optimization and stakeholder insights

## Why This Works for 15-Second Scan:
1. **Quantified results** (79% accuracy, 22% improvement)
2. **Technical depth** (ensemble methods, hyperparameter tuning)
3. **Problem-solving** (API failure resolution)
4. **Business impact** (stakeholder insights)
5. **Concise** - 4 bullets, easy to scan
