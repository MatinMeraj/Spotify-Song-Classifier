            Extracts 9 audio features from Spotify API: tempo, energy, valence, loudness, danceability, speechiness,

            Applies VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a rule-based sentiment analyzer, to song lyrics.
            Sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) are mapped to compound scores and then to the four mood classes. The
            lyrics model achieved 26% accuracy with a strong bias toward sad and happy.

            Started with 500,000 tracks containing audio features and mood labels from 10 categories. Mapped to 4 target moods
            (happy, chill, sad, hyped) and downsampled to create a balanced dataset of 20,000 songs (5,000 per mood). Data
            sourced from Spotify with both audio features and lyrics for comprehensive analysis.

            Models evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and confidence thresholds. Among Logistic Regression, KNN,
            and Random Forest, the Random Forest performed best with 35.2% test accuracy (vs. 25% random chance). The lyrics
            model achieved 26% accuracy with a strong bias toward sad and happy. Agreement analysis shows 25.7% agreement
            between the two pipelines.
